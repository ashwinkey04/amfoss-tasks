# Welcome to my amFOSS Tasks repo
This is Ashwin, fresher at Amrita School of Engineering (CSE 2019). 

## About my tasks

I would say that the tasks were crafted to pick the best (exactly why I couldn't finish them all :P). Though I am not done with all of them, I learnt a lot about most of tasks and they would really prove beneficial to me in the long run. 

## Who's me?

I am from, was born, brought up in Coimbatore. My answer to why I joined Amrita wouldn't be real fascinating as that was probably the only good option I had, since I was adamant about pursuing Computer science for my higher studies. The reason why I was so was because I think I have true passion for coding. I've been a noob Android developer since my 8th grade (I won't say I've crossed the noob mark yet). Apparently I know some Java and XML. I'm acquainted with Unity, After effects, Construct. Been fiddling with different Linux distros for a year now, so I kinda know some terminal commands.I am the Smartphone ROM flashing consultant for my friends ;) A Member in Quora Partner Program. I also try and keep track on whatever's buzzing around new in the tech world. 
FOSS seems to be the ideal place to help myself out to have a better knowledge on things I like and make myself a better person as well.
