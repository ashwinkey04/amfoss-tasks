#Pong game

Since I am not familiar with Javascript, I initially went through [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) for learning the basics of Javascript for both of this task and task-5 (Get it using JavaScript). Then I looked up on existing codes and articles [1](https://medium.com/@hershybateea/how-to-make-pong-with-javascript-1a6bd6226ea1) for pong games in java script. 
After referring these, I wrote a html/css code for the skeleton of the game (Bats and Ball). The output was not really desirable, so I didn't push the code.
